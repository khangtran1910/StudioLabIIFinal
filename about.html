			        <p>Hello! My name is Khang Nguyen Tran (Khang Tran). I am from Vietnam and I have been living in Ottawa for 2 years. I am a student of Algonquin College - IMM program.I graduated from a university in my hometown (4-years Corporate Communication), followed by 1 year post secondary program (Event Management) at Algonquin College. Currently, I am studying Integrated Media Management at Algonquin College with the duration of 1 year and I will finish my education in April 2020. I like music, design, reading, swimming and animals. For the future, I want to look for a job in media field which is related to design. I can also work as an event planner and I am trying my best to learn designing skills from the IMM course to support my experiences and maybe become a good designer as well. I used to work as an event staff and volunteer and I am learning for new skills from school (designing skills). I am willing to learn new knowledge, adaptable, creative and a good communicator as well.</p>
